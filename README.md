💻 I'm Francesco Di Salvo, a `Data Science and Engineering student` at Politecnico di Torino. I am currently working on my Master Thesis about breast cancer diagnosis through CT image analysis at `Radboud Univerisity Medical Center` (Nijmegen, NL). Before that I was a Deep Learning Engineer Intern at `AIKO - Autonomous Space Mission`, where I worked on monocular visual odometry in hostile environments. In my free time I write contents for `stAI tuned` , a community that I founded with some good friends! 

Moreover... 
* 📚 I'm working on [stAI tuned](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=stai%20tuned&origin=RICH_QUERY_TYPEAHEAD_HISTORY&position=0&searchId=7f0cdea8-e19b-4aad-9f7b-77675b2db6fe&sid=WFJ)'s blog 
* 🏋🏼 🚴🏼 I'm working on my strength and my resistence 
* 🧑🏼‍🍳 I'm trying to improve my cooking skills
